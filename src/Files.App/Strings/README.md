These are the translation/i18n resources for Files.

---

Currently, Crowdin translation is implemented to manage the translation resources for Files. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged, if not required, to translate exclusively on that platform.
No matter how great, your translation PRs will be declined or rejected if you do not adhere to this.
You can contribute easily at [crowdin.com/files](https://crowdin.com/project/files-app), which will ensure your translations are implemented.
If a language is missing and you'd like to contribute a new one, feel free to ask in a new issue or via [the Files Discord server](https://discord.gg/files).

Please also be aware of our [translation docs](https://files.community/docs/contributing/translating) which will assist you in translating the app if you are unsure how to do so. If you're unsure of the translation style you should employ, please ask a member of the Files Organization on [the Files Discord server](https://discord.gg/files).
