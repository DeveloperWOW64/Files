# `src/Files.App/Views`

This folder contains views and UI code for Files.
Considering that Files uses the MVVM app model, views are stored here, models are stored in [`Models`](https://github.com/files-community/Files/blob/main/src/Files.App/Models), and view models are stored in [`ViewModels`](https://github.com/files-community/Files/blob/main/src/Files.App/ViewModels).
