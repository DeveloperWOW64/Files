# `src/Files.App`

This WinUI3/WinAppSdk project contains the core source for Files and the application definition. Most of the app's processes and core code is stored here, especially the UI.
Files uses the MVVM app model, and code style for developing the app can be found [here](https://files.community/docs/contributing/code-style).
