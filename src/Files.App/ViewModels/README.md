# `src/Files.App/ViewsModels`

This folder contains code that supports the UI.
Considering that Files uses the MVVM app model, view models are stored here, views are stored [`Views`](https://github.com/files-community/Files/blob/main/src/Files.App/Views), and models are stored in [`Models`](https://github.com/files-community/Files/blob/main/src/Files.App/Views).
